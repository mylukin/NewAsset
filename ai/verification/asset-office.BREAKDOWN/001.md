## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/asset-office/

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Fine-grained implementation tasks exist in ai/tasks/asset-office/ directory: 01-database-schema.md, 02-entity.md, 03-service.md, 04-controller.md, 05-frontend-list.md, 06-frontend-detail.md, and 07-frontend-form.md. Each file contains detailed task definitions.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-office/01-database-schema.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/02-entity.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/03-service.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/04-controller.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/05-frontend-list.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/06-frontend-detail.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/07-frontend-form.md`

### 2. Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 95%

**Reasoning**:

Each task file has specific, testable acceptance criteria. For example, 01-database-schema.md has 4 criteria including table fields, foreign key, migration file location, and dictionary entries. 02-entity.md has 5 criteria covering entity class, mapper interface, XML file, DTOs, and compilation. 03-service.md has 4 criteria for service interface, implementation, query filters, and error handling. All criteria are concrete and verifiable.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-office/01-database-schema.md:26-41`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/02-entity.md:26-46`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/03-service.md:26-46`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/04-controller.md:26-49`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/05-frontend-list.md:26-47`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/06-frontend-detail.md:26-49`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/07-frontend-form.md:26-61`

### 3. Task dependencies on core module are correctly defined

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Task dependencies on core module are correctly defined in the dependsOn field. 01-database-schema depends on core.database-schema. 02-entity depends on asset-office.database-schema AND core.asset-entity. 03-service depends on asset-office.entity AND core.base-service. The dependency chain properly references core module tasks.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-office/01-database-schema.md:8-9`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/02-entity.md:8-10`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/03-service.md:8-10`

### 4. Database schema for extension table is included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Database schema task (01-database-schema.md) defines the t_asset_office extension table with all required fields: asset_id (PK/FK), office_type, serial_number, configuration, use_department, user_name. Foreign key constraint and SQL migration file location are specified.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-office/01-database-schema.md:26-36`

### 5. Office-specific service and controller tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Office-specific service task (03-service.md) defines IAssetOfficeService interface and AssetOfficeServiceImpl with CRUD operations, transactional behavior, and query filters. Controller task (04-controller.md) defines AssetOfficeController with REST endpoints, permission annotations, audit logging, and validation.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-office/03-service.md:26-46`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/04-controller.md:26-49`

### 6. Frontend list, detail, and form tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Frontend tasks are included: 05-frontend-list.md covers API file and list page with search, table, and actions. 06-frontend-detail.md covers detail drawer with 3 tabs (Basic Info, Maintenance Records, Attachments). 07-frontend-form.md covers create/edit form with grouped sections and validation.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-office/05-frontend-list.md:26-47`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/06-frontend-detail.md:26-49`
- `ai/tasks/asset-office/07-frontend-form.md:26-61`

## Overall Assessment

All 6 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied. The ai/tasks/asset-office/ directory contains 7 well-structured task files (01-database-schema.md through 07-frontend-form.md) with specific, testable acceptance criteria. Dependencies on core module are correctly defined (core.database-schema, core.asset-entity, core.base-service). The database schema task includes the extension table definition. Service and controller tasks are included. Frontend list, detail, and form tasks are all present with detailed specifications. The task breakdown follows the same pattern as other asset modules (house, parking, facility, venue) ensuring consistency.

## Suggestions

- Consider adding an optional statistics task (similar to asset-house.statistics) for tracking office asset usage metrics
- The index.json uses global priority numbers (601-607) but task files use local priorities (1-7). Ensure consistency or document this intentional design choice.

## Code Quality Notes

- Good use of consistent task structure across all asset modules
- Dependencies are properly chained (schema → entity → service → controller → frontend)
- Each task includes testRequirements with appropriate patterns for backend vs frontend tasks
- Technical notes reference related tasks and documentation for implementation guidance
