## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/asset-parking/

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/asset-parking/. Found 8 task files: 01-database-schema.md, 02-entity.md, 03-service.md, 04-controller.md, 05-statistics.md, 06-frontend-list.md, 07-frontend-detail.md, 08-frontend-form.md

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/01-database-schema.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/02-entity.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/03-service.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/04-controller.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/05-statistics.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/06-frontend-list.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/07-frontend-detail.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/08-frontend-form.md`

### 2. Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 95%

**Reasoning**:

Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria with numbered items. For example: database-schema has 4 criteria (table creation, FK constraint, SQL file, dictionary entries); entity has 5 criteria (entity class, mapper, XML, DTOs, compilation); service has 5 criteria (interface, impl, create/update/delete operations); controller has 4 criteria (class, endpoints, logging, data scope); statistics has 6 criteria (methods, calculations, VOs, API endpoint, tests); frontend tasks each have 4-5 criteria.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/01-database-schema.md:26-43`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/02-entity.md:27-43`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/03-service.md:30-51`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/04-controller.md:26-53`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/05-statistics.md:28-53`

### 3. Task dependencies on core module are correctly defined

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Task dependencies on core module are correctly defined. database-schema depends on core.database-schema; entity depends on asset-parking.database-schema and core.asset-entity; service depends on asset-parking.entity and core.base-service; controller depends on asset-parking.service; statistics depends on asset-parking.service; frontend tasks depend on asset-parking.controller

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/01-database-schema.md:8-9`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/02-entity.md:8-10`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/03-service.md:8-10`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/04-controller.md:8-9`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/05-statistics.md:8-9`

### 4. Database schema for extension table is included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Database schema for extension table is included in 01-database-schema.md with detailed field specifications including asset_id (PK/FK), parking_no, parking_zone, parking_type, area, current_user, plate_no, rent_price, contract_no. Also includes FK constraint requirement and dictionary entries for parking_type and parking_zone.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/01-database-schema.md:26-44`

### 5. Parking-specific service and controller tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Parking-specific service task (03-service.md) and controller task (04-controller.md) are included with detailed acceptance criteria. Service includes interface definition, implementation class, CRUD operations with transaction handling. Controller includes REST endpoints (list, get, create, update, delete, export) with permission annotations.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/03-service.md:1-55`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/04-controller.md:1-57`

### 6. Statistics calculation tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Statistics calculation task (05-statistics.md) is included with detailed criteria: getStats and getStatsByZone methods, calculation formulas for total/self-use/rented/idle counts and utilization rate, ParkingStatsVO and ZoneStatsVO definitions, API endpoint /asset/parking/stats, and unit test requirement.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/05-statistics.md:1-57`

### 7. Frontend list, detail, and form tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Frontend list (06-frontend-list.md), detail (07-frontend-detail.md), and form (08-frontend-form.md) tasks are all included. List page includes API file, page component with search/action bar/data table. Detail drawer includes 3 tabs (basic info, maintenance records, attachments). Form component includes grouped sections for basic info, parking details, usage info, and attachments.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/06-frontend-list.md:1-53`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/07-frontend-detail.md:1-54`
- `ai/tasks/asset-parking/08-frontend-form.md:1-64`

## Overall Assessment

All 7 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied. The ai/tasks/asset-parking/ directory contains 8 well-structured task files covering the complete parking asset module implementation: database schema, entity/mapper, service, controller, statistics, and 3 frontend components (list, detail, form). Each task has specific, numbered acceptance criteria that are testable. Dependencies are correctly defined with core module tasks (core.database-schema, core.asset-entity, core.base-service) and sequential dependencies within the module. The index.json is also properly updated with all 8 tasks registered with correct priorities (301-308), status (failing), and file paths.

## Suggestions

- Consider adding integration test requirements for the controller endpoints
- The statistics task could benefit from specifying caching strategy for performance

## Code Quality Notes

- Good use of consistent task structure across all files
- Clear separation of concerns with database -> entity -> service -> controller flow
- Dependencies are logically organized with both core module and intra-module dependencies
- Test requirements are appropriately specified with unit tests for service/statistics and e2e for frontend
