## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/asset-facility/

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/asset-facility/. Found 8 task files: 01-database-schema.md, 02-entity.md, 03-service.md, 04-controller.md, 05-warranty-alert.md, 06-frontend-list.md, 07-frontend-detail.md, 08-frontend-form.md

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/01-database-schema.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/02-entity.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/03-service.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/04-controller.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/05-warranty-alert.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/06-frontend-list.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/07-frontend-detail.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/08-frontend-form.md`

### 2. Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 95%

**Reasoning**:

Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria. The database-schema task has 4 criteria with specific table fields. The entity task has 5 criteria with specific classes. The service task has 4 criteria with specific methods. The controller task has 6 criteria with specific endpoints. The warranty-alert task has 4 criteria. The frontend tasks each have 4-5 criteria with specific UI elements and functionality.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/01-database-schema.md:26-47 (4 testable criteria)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/02-entity.md:27-46 (5 testable criteria)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/03-service.md:27-46 (4 testable criteria)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/04-controller.md:27-49 (6 testable criteria)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/05-warranty-alert.md:26-41 (4 testable criteria)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/06-frontend-list.md:28-50 (5 testable criteria)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/07-frontend-detail.md:28-53 (4 testable criteria)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/08-frontend-form.md:28-63 (4 testable criteria)`

### 3. Task dependencies on core module are correctly defined

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 95%

**Reasoning**:

Task dependencies on core module are correctly defined. The database-schema task depends on core.database-schema. The entity task depends on asset-facility.database-schema and core.asset-entity. The service task depends on asset-facility.entity and core.base-service. The controller depends on asset-facility.service. Frontend tasks depend on the controller. All dependencies follow logical order.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/01-database-schema.md:8-9 (dependsOn: core.database-schema)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/02-entity.md:8-10 (dependsOn: asset-facility.database-schema, core.asset-entity)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/03-service.md:8-10 (dependsOn: asset-facility.entity, core.base-service)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/04-controller.md:8-9 (dependsOn: asset-facility.service)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/BREAKDOWN.md:8-9 (dependsOn: core.BREAKDOWN)`

### 4. Database schema for extension table is included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Database schema for extension table is included in 01-database-schema.md task. It specifies t_asset_facility table with all facility-specific fields: asset_id, facility_type, device_code, install_location, maintenance_org, maintenance_phone, warranty_expire_date. Also includes FK constraint and dictionary entries for facility types.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/01-database-schema.md:26-34 (table structure with 7 fields)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/01-database-schema.md:35 (FK constraint)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/01-database-schema.md:37 (migration file location)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/01-database-schema.md:39-47 (dictionary entries for 8 facility types)`

### 5. Facility-specific service and controller tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Facility-specific service and controller tasks are included. 03-service.md defines IAssetFacilityService interface with list, getById, create, update, delete, export methods plus transactional operations. 04-controller.md defines REST API with all CRUD endpoints. 05-warranty-alert.md adds facility-specific warranty tracking feature.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/03-service.md (complete service layer task)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/04-controller.md (complete controller task)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/05-warranty-alert.md (facility-specific warranty feature)`

### 6. Frontend list, detail, and form tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Frontend list, detail, and form tasks are all included. 06-frontend-list.md defines the list page with search, data table, status filters. 07-frontend-detail.md defines detail drawer with 3 tabs (Basic Info, Maintenance Records, Attachments). 08-frontend-form.md defines create/edit form with all sections.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/06-frontend-list.md (list page with table, filters, actions)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/07-frontend-detail.md (detail drawer with tabs)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-facility/08-frontend-form.md (form component with validation)`

## Overall Assessment

All 6 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied. The asset-facility module has 8 well-structured implementation tasks created in ai/tasks/asset-facility/. Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria with clear requirements. Dependencies on core module tasks are correctly defined (core.database-schema, core.asset-entity, core.base-service). The database schema task includes complete extension table design with all fields, FK constraints, and dictionary entries. Backend service and controller tasks cover all CRUD operations plus facility-specific warranty alerts. Frontend tasks cover list page, detail drawer, and form component with full specifications.

## Suggestions

- Consider adding integration test task for the complete facility asset workflow
- The warranty-alert task could be expanded to include notification/email alerts in future iterations
- Consider adding a statistics task similar to asset-house.statistics for facility utilization metrics

## Code Quality Notes

- Good task structure following established patterns from asset-house module
- Clear dependency chain: database -> entity -> service -> controller -> frontend
- Consistent use of testRequirements patterns for both unit and e2e tests
- Well-documented acceptance criteria with specific field names, method signatures, and UI elements
