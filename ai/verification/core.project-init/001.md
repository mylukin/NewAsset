## Automated Checks

_No automated checks were run_

## Acceptance Criteria

_No criteria were evaluated_

## Overall Assessment

No explicit acceptance criteria were provided in the prompt, so there are no criteria to verify against. The diff only updates repository metadata and task documentation (adds custom harness commands in `ai/capabilities.json` and adds `tddGuidance` in `ai/tasks/core/project-init.md`), and it does not include any implementation changes that would conclusively demonstrate that the RuoYi-Vue project initialization or `ruoyi-asset` scaffolding behavior is implemented or correct. No automated checks were run, further reducing verification confidence.

## Suggestions

- Add explicit acceptance criteria for `core.project-init` (e.g., required directories/files, Maven module registration, minimal controller skeleton, and any CI/check expectations) so verification can be objective.
- Fix the likely shell-redirection bug in `ai/capabilities.json` custom rule `harness.check.task` where `./ai/init.sh check <task_id>` will be interpreted as input redirection in POSIX shells; use a literal placeholder format (e.g., `./ai/init.sh check {task_id}`) or provide a concrete example command.
- Consider reverting or validating `testInfo.packageManager: "pnpm"` unless the repo actually uses pnpm; otherwise capability metadata may mislead automation/users.
- Add a trailing newline to `ai/capabilities.json` to avoid tooling diffs and POSIX text-file warnings.
- Ensure the added harness commands are executable and documented (e.g., confirm `ai/init.sh` supports `bootstrap`, `check`, `status` and document required prerequisites like `agent-foreman`).
- If `tddGuidance` is intended to be actionable, add the referenced test file `tests/core/project-init.test.ts` (or adjust guidance to match the actual test stack) and run it in CI.

## Code Quality Notes

- `ai/capabilities.json` is missing a trailing newline (file ends with `}`), which can cause minor tooling/formatting issues.
- The custom rule command `./ai/init.sh check <task_id>` (in `ai/capabilities.json:82-86`) is likely incorrect in a real shell because `<task_id>` is parsed as stdin redirection, not a placeholder argument.
- Capability metadata appears speculative: `testInfo.available` remains `false` and `packageManager` is set to `pnpm` (`ai/capabilities.json:29-37`) while no evidence in the diff shows a pnpm workspace/package.json; this can lead to failing bootstrap/check flows.
- `ai/tasks/core/project-init.md` adds `tddGuidance` with `frameworkHint: vitest` and a suggested test file that does not exist, which may confuse contributors if treated as executable guidance (`ai/tasks/core/project-init.md:11-46`).
