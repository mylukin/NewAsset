## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/dashboard/

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/dashboard/ directory. Found 6 task files: 01-statistics-service.md, 02-controller.md, 03-frontend-layout.md, 04-kpi-cards.md, 05-charts.md, and 06-refresh-button.md

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/01-statistics-service.md`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/02-controller.md`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/03-frontend-layout.md`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/04-kpi-cards.md`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/05-charts.md`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/06-refresh-button.md`

### 2. Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 95%

**Reasoning**:

Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria. For example: statistics-service has 5 numbered criteria covering interface methods, implementation class, VO structure, mapper methods, and performance requirement (<2s). Controller has 5 criteria with specific endpoints and permissions. Frontend tasks have detailed component specs with props, behavior, and styling requirements.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/01-statistics-service.md:29-54 (5 detailed criteria)`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/02-controller.md:29-56 (5 criteria with specific endpoints)`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/04-kpi-cards.md:28-66 (4 criteria with card specifications)`

### 3. Task dependencies on core, asset, and maintenance modules are defined

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Task dependencies on core, asset, and maintenance modules are properly defined in the dependsOn field. statistics-service depends on core.base-service, asset-house.service, asset-parking.service, and maintenance.order-service. Controller depends on dashboard.statistics-service. Frontend tasks chain appropriately with dashboard.controller and dashboard.frontend-layout.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/01-statistics-service.md:8-12 (dependsOn: core.base-service, asset-house.service, asset-parking.service, maintenance.order-service)`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/02-controller.md:8-9 (dependsOn: dashboard.statistics-service)`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/03-frontend-layout.md:8-9 (dependsOn: dashboard.controller)`

### 4. Statistics service with aggregation queries is included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Statistics service with aggregation queries is included. The 01-statistics-service.md task defines IDashboardService interface with getStats, getRecentOrders, getAssetDistribution, getStatusDistribution methods. DashboardStats VO includes aggregated fields. Mapper methods for aggregation (countByStatus, countByType, sumAssets) are specified with SQL COUNT/SUM for performance.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/01-statistics-service.md:29-34 (interface methods)`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/01-statistics-service.md:39-47 (DashboardStats VO with aggregation fields)`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/01-statistics-service.md:49-53 (mapper aggregation methods)`

### 5. Role-based dashboard layout tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Role-based dashboard layout tasks are included. The 03-frontend-layout.md task explicitly defines three role-based layout variants: Management/Operations Layout (4 KPI cards, charts, activity table), Maintenance Staff Layout (2 cards, simplified view, no charts), and Asset Manager Layout (4 KPI cards, distribution pies, recent assets table). Role detection from Vuex store is specified.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/03-frontend-layout.md:38-54 (three role-based layout variants)`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/03-frontend-layout.md:56 (Role detection from Vuex store)`

### 6. KPI cards and charts tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

KPI cards and charts tasks are included as separate, detailed task files. 04-kpi-cards.md covers KpiCard component with Total Assets, Vacancy Rate, Pending Work Orders, and Completed This Month cards. 05-charts.md covers ECharts integration with StatusPieChart, AssetTypePieChart, and TrendLineChart components.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/04-kpi-cards.md:28-66 (KpiCard component and 4 specific KPI cards)`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/05-charts.md:28-61 (ECharts with 3 chart components)`

### 7. Manual refresh functionality is included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Manual refresh functionality is included as a dedicated task. 06-refresh-button.md defines refresh button implementation with position, icon, loading state, disable during loading, last updated timestamp, success/error toasts, optional keyboard shortcut, and visual feedback (spin animation, fade-in effect).

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/06-refresh-button.md:28-53 (5 detailed acceptance criteria for refresh functionality)`

## Overall Assessment

All 7 acceptance criteria for the Dashboard Module Breakdown are fully satisfied. The dashboard module has been broken down into 6 fine-grained implementation tasks in ai/tasks/dashboard/. Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria with clear technical specifications. Dependencies on core, asset, and maintenance modules are properly defined using the dependsOn field. The statistics service includes comprehensive aggregation queries. Role-based dashboard layouts are detailed for three different user roles. KPI cards and charts are covered in dedicated tasks with component specifications. Manual refresh functionality is fully specified with UI and behavior requirements.

## Code Quality Notes

- Task files follow consistent YAML frontmatter format
- Clear separation of concerns between backend (statistics-service, controller) and frontend (layout, cards, charts, refresh) tasks
- Appropriate use of testRequirements patterns for unit and e2e tests
- Good reference to upstream specification documents (OVERVIEW.md, UX-DESIGN.md)
