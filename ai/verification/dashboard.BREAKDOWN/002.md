## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/dashboard/

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

6 fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/dashboard/: 01-statistics-service.md, 02-controller.md, 03-frontend-layout.md, 04-kpi-cards.md, 05-charts.md, and 06-refresh-button.md. All tasks are properly registered in ai/tasks/index.json with unique IDs (dashboard.statistics-service, dashboard.controller, dashboard.frontend-layout, dashboard.kpi-cards, dashboard.charts, dashboard.refresh-button).

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/01-statistics-service.md`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/02-controller.md`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/03-frontend-layout.md`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/04-kpi-cards.md`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/05-charts.md`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/06-refresh-button.md`
- `ai/tasks/index.json:528-568`

### 2. Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 95%

**Reasoning**:

Each task has detailed, specific, and testable acceptance criteria. For example: dashboard.statistics-service has 5 numbered criteria with specific interface methods, VO fields, and performance requirements (<2s). dashboard.controller has 5 criteria with specific endpoints, paths, and permission annotations. dashboard.kpi-cards has 4 criteria with specific card implementations, props, and styling requirements. All criteria are measurable and verifiable.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/01-statistics-service.md:29-54`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/02-controller.md:29-56`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/04-kpi-cards.md:28-65`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/05-charts.md:28-61`

### 3. Task dependencies on core, asset, and maintenance modules are defined

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Task dependencies are properly defined in YAML frontmatter. dashboard.statistics-service depends on core.base-service, asset-house.service, asset-parking.service, maintenance.order-service. dashboard.controller depends on dashboard.statistics-service. Frontend tasks (layout, kpi-cards, charts, refresh-button) depend on dashboard.controller or dashboard.frontend-layout. The BREAKDOWN.md itself depends on core.BREAKDOWN, asset-house.BREAKDOWN, asset-parking.BREAKDOWN, maintenance.BREAKDOWN.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/01-statistics-service.md:8-12`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/02-controller.md:8-9`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/03-frontend-layout.md:8-9`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/BREAKDOWN.md:8-12`

### 4. Statistics service with aggregation queries is included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

dashboard.statistics-service (01-statistics-service.md) includes comprehensive aggregation query requirements: IDashboardService interface with getStats, getRecentOrders, getAssetDistribution, getStatusDistribution methods. Specifies aggregation queries using SQL COUNT/SUM, mapper methods for countByStatus, countByType, sumAssets, and performance requirement of <2s.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/01-statistics-service.md:29-54`

### 5. Role-based dashboard layout tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

dashboard.frontend-layout (03-frontend-layout.md) includes 3 role-based layout variants: Management/Operations Layout (KPI cards, charts, recent activity), Maintenance Staff Layout (simplified view, work order queue, no charts), and Asset Manager Layout (asset counts, distribution charts, recent additions). Role detection from Vuex store is specified.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/03-frontend-layout.md:38-57`

### 6. KPI cards and charts tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

KPI cards task (04-kpi-cards.md) specifies reusable KpiCard.vue component with props (title, value, suffix, icon, trend, color) and 4 specific cards (Total Assets, Vacancy Rate, Pending Work Orders, Completed This Month). Charts task (05-charts.md) specifies ECharts integration with StatusPieChart.vue, AssetTypePieChart.vue, TrendLineChart.vue, and ChartWrapper.vue components.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/04-kpi-cards.md:28-65`
- `ai/tasks/dashboard/05-charts.md:28-61`

### 7. Manual refresh functionality is included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

dashboard.refresh-button (06-refresh-button.md) includes comprehensive manual refresh functionality: refresh button in header, loading state during fetch, button disable during loading, 'Last updated: HH:mm' timestamp, refresh logic calling all dashboard APIs, success/error toasts, optional keyboard shortcuts, and visual feedback (spin animation, fade-in effect).

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/dashboard/06-refresh-button.md:28-52`

## Overall Assessment

All 7 acceptance criteria for the Dashboard Module Breakdown are satisfied with high confidence. The ai/tasks/dashboard/ directory contains 6 fine-grained implementation tasks plus the BREAKDOWN.md file. Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria with clear requirements. Dependencies on core, asset, and maintenance modules are properly defined in the YAML frontmatter. The statistics service task includes aggregation queries and performance requirements. Role-based layout variants are specified for 3 user roles. KPI cards and ECharts integration are detailed. Manual refresh functionality is comprehensively specified.

## Code Quality Notes

- Task structure follows the project's established patterns
- Dependencies are well-organized in a logical order (backend → frontend)
- Test requirements are specified with appropriate patterns for each task type
- Priority ordering (1-6) reflects correct implementation sequence
