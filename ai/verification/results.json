      "overallReasoning": "No explicit acceptance criteria were provided in the prompt, so there are no criteria to verify against. The diff only updates repository metadata and task documentation (adds custom harness commands in `ai/capabilities.json` and adds `tddGuidance` in `ai/tasks/core/project-init.md`), and it does not include any implementation changes that would conclusively demonstrate that the RuoYi-Vue project initialization or `ruoyi-asset` scaffolding behavior is implemented or correct. No automated checks were run, further reducing verification confidence.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Add explicit acceptance criteria for `core.project-init` (e.g., required directories/files, Maven module registration, minimal controller skeleton, and any CI/check expectations) so verification can be objective.",
        "Fix the likely shell-redirection bug in `ai/capabilities.json` custom rule `harness.check.task` where `./ai/init.sh check <task_id>` will be interpreted as input redirection in POSIX shells; use a literal placeholder format (e.g., `./ai/init.sh check {task_id}`) or provide a concrete example command.",
        "Consider reverting or validating `testInfo.packageManager: \"pnpm\"` unless the repo actually uses pnpm; otherwise capability metadata may mislead automation/users.",
        "Add a trailing newline to `ai/capabilities.json` to avoid tooling diffs and POSIX text-file warnings.",
        "Ensure the added harness commands are executable and documented (e.g., confirm `ai/init.sh` supports `bootstrap`, `check`, `status` and document required prerequisites like `agent-foreman`).",
        "If `tddGuidance` is intended to be actionable, add the referenced test file `tests/core/project-init.test.ts` (or adjust guidance to match the actual test stack) and run it in CI."
      ],
      "codeQualityNotes": [
        "`ai/capabilities.json` is missing a trailing newline (file ends with `}`), which can cause minor tooling/formatting issues.",
        "The custom rule command `./ai/init.sh check <task_id>` (in `ai/capabilities.json:82-86`) is likely incorrect in a real shell because `<task_id>` is parsed as stdin redirection, not a placeholder argument.",
        "Capability metadata appears speculative: `testInfo.available` remains `false` and `packageManager` is set to `pnpm` (`ai/capabilities.json:29-37`) while no evidence in the diff shows a pnpm workspace/package.json; this can lead to failing bootstrap/check flows.",
        "`ai/tasks/core/project-init.md` adds `tddGuidance` with `frameworkHint: vitest` and a suggested test file that does not exist, which may confuse contributors if treated as executable guidance (`ai/tasks/core/project-init.md:11-46`)."
