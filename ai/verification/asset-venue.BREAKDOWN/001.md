## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/asset-venue/

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/asset-venue/. There are 7 implementation task files: 01-database-schema.md, 02-entity.md, 03-service.md, 04-controller.md, 05-frontend-list.md, 06-frontend-detail.md, and 07-frontend-form.md

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/01-database-schema.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/02-entity.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/03-service.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/04-controller.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/05-frontend-list.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/06-frontend-detail.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/07-frontend-form.md`

### 2. Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 95%

**Reasoning**:

Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria. For example: database-schema task has 4 criteria including specific table structure and dictionary entries; entity task has 5 criteria for entity, mapper, XML, and DTO classes; service task has 4 criteria for interface methods and implementation; controller task has 6 criteria for endpoints and permissions; frontend tasks have detailed criteria for components, forms, and behaviors

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/01-database-schema.md:26-41`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/02-entity.md:27-46`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/03-service.md:27-44`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/04-controller.md:29-49`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/05-frontend-list.md:28-48`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/06-frontend-detail.md:28-52`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/07-frontend-form.md:28-59`

### 3. Task dependencies on core module are correctly defined

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Task dependencies on core module are correctly defined. database-schema depends on core.database-schema; entity depends on asset-venue.database-schema and core.asset-entity; service depends on asset-venue.entity and core.base-service; controller depends on asset-venue.service; frontend tasks chain correctly with frontend-list depending on controller, and detail/form depending on frontend-list

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/01-database-schema.md:8-9 (dependsOn: core.database-schema)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/02-entity.md:8-10 (dependsOn: asset-venue.database-schema, core.asset-entity)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/03-service.md:8-10 (dependsOn: asset-venue.entity, core.base-service)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/04-controller.md:8-9 (dependsOn: asset-venue.service)`

### 4. Database schema for extension table is included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Database schema for extension table is included in 01-database-schema.md with detailed field specifications including asset_id (PK/FK), venue_type, capacity, usage_mode, open_time_desc, and availability_status. Foreign key constraint and SQL migration file location are specified. Dictionary entries for venue_type, usage_mode, and availability_status are defined

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/01-database-schema.md:26-41`

### 5. Venue-specific service and controller tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Venue-specific service and controller tasks are included. Service task (03-service.md) defines IAssetVenueService interface with CRUD methods and AssetVenueServiceImpl with transactional operations. Controller task (04-controller.md) defines AssetVenueController with REST endpoints at /api/asset/venue including list, get, create, update, delete, and export operations with proper RuoYi permission annotations

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/03-service.md:27-44`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/04-controller.md:26-49`

### 6. Frontend list, detail, and form tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Frontend list, detail, and form tasks are included. 05-frontend-list.md defines the list page with API file, search bar, action bar, data table, and status filter tabs. 06-frontend-detail.md defines a detail drawer with 3 tabs (Basic Info, Maintenance Records, Attachments) and availability badges. 07-frontend-form.md defines a form component with Basic Information, Location, Venue Details, and Attachments sections with validation rules

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/05-frontend-list.md:28-48`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/06-frontend-detail.md:28-52`
- `ai/tasks/asset-venue/07-frontend-form.md:28-59`

## Overall Assessment

All 6 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied. The asset-venue module has been properly broken down into 7 fine-grained implementation tasks (database-schema, entity, service, controller, frontend-list, frontend-detail, frontend-form). Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria with detailed field specifications, API endpoints, UI components, and validation rules. Dependencies on core module tasks are correctly defined with proper dependency chains. The tasks are properly registered in ai/tasks/index.json with appropriate priorities (501-507) and file path references.

## Suggestions

- Consider adding an explicit 'statistics' task similar to asset-house and asset-parking modules if venue utilization metrics are needed
- The testRequirements patterns could be more specific (e.g., tests/asset-venue/database-schema.test.ts) rather than generic glob patterns

## Code Quality Notes

- Good task structure following the established pattern from other asset modules (house, parking, facility)
- Clear dependency chain from database → entity → service → controller → frontend
- Proper use of YAML frontmatter with all required fields (id, module, priority, status, version, origin, dependsOn, tags, testRequirements)
- Detailed technical notes referencing related tasks for consistency
