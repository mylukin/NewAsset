## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/asset-house/

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

All fine-grained implementation tasks are created in ai/tasks/asset-house/. There are 8 task files: 01-database-schema.md, 02-entity.md, 03-service.md, 04-controller.md, 05-statistics.md, 06-frontend-list.md, 07-frontend-detail.md, 08-frontend-form.md. Each represents a distinct implementation step.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-house/01-database-schema.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/02-entity.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/03-service.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/04-controller.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/05-statistics.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/06-frontend-list.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/07-frontend-detail.md`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/08-frontend-form.md`

### 2. Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 95%

**Reasoning**:

Each task has specific, testable acceptance criteria. For example: database-schema has 4 criteria about table creation; entity has 5 criteria about entity/mapper creation; service has 6 criteria about service methods; controller has 4 criteria about REST endpoints; statistics has 5 criteria about calculation methods; frontend tasks each have 5-6 criteria about Vue components and UI elements.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-house/01-database-schema.md:26-45`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/02-entity.md:27-45`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/03-service.md:31-62`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/04-controller.md:26-68`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/05-statistics.md:29-59`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/06-frontend-list.md:28-61`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/07-frontend-detail.md:28-61`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/08-frontend-form.md:28-86`

### 3. Task dependencies on core module are correctly defined

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 98%

**Reasoning**:

Task dependencies on core module are correctly defined using YAML frontmatter 'dependsOn' field. database-schema depends on core.database-schema; entity depends on core.asset-entity and asset-house.database-schema; service depends on core.base-service and asset-house.entity; controller depends on asset-house.service; statistics depends on asset-house.service; frontend tasks depend on controller/list as appropriate.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-house/01-database-schema.md:8-9 (dependsOn: core.database-schema)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/02-entity.md:8-11 (dependsOn: asset-house.database-schema, core.asset-entity)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/03-service.md:8-11 (dependsOn: asset-house.entity, core.base-service)`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/04-controller.md:8-9 (dependsOn: asset-house.service)`

### 4. Database schema for extension table is included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Database schema for extension table t_asset_house is fully defined in 01-database-schema.md with all required fields: asset_id (PK/FK), building_area, inner_area, house_type, house_usage, current_usage, current_user, contract_no, rent_unit_price, rent_total. Foreign key constraint and dictionary entries are specified.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-house/01-database-schema.md:26-45`

### 5. House-specific service and controller tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

House-specific service task (03-service.md) includes all CRUD operations plus copy feature. Controller task (04-controller.md) includes all REST endpoints: list, get, create, update, delete, copy, export with proper permissions.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-house/03-service.md:31-62`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/04-controller.md:26-68`

### 6. Statistics calculation tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

Statistics calculation task (05-statistics.md) is fully defined with: vacancy rate calculation, rental rate calculation, usage distribution, HouseStatsVO definition, and dedicated API endpoint GET /asset/house/stats.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-house/05-statistics.md:29-59`

### 7. Frontend list, detail, and form tasks are included

- **Satisfied**: ✅ Yes
- **Confidence**: 100%

**Reasoning**:

All frontend tasks are included: 06-frontend-list.md covers list page with search, table, pagination; 07-frontend-detail.md covers detail drawer with tabs for info/maintenance/attachments; 08-frontend-form.md covers create/edit form with sections and validation.

**Evidence**:

- `ai/tasks/asset-house/06-frontend-list.md:28-61`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/07-frontend-detail.md:28-61`
- `ai/tasks/asset-house/08-frontend-form.md:28-86`

## Overall Assessment

All 7 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied with high confidence. The asset-house module breakdown includes 8 well-structured task files covering database schema, entity, service, controller, statistics, and 3 frontend components (list, detail, form). Each task has specific testable acceptance criteria with detailed requirements. Dependencies on core module components are properly defined. The database schema includes the complete t_asset_house extension table design. Service and controller tasks cover all CRUD operations plus house-specific features like copy and statistics. Frontend tasks comprehensively cover the list page, detail drawer, and form component with Vue/Element UI specifications.

## Suggestions

- Consider adding integration test requirements to the testRequirements section for backend tasks
- The frontend tasks could benefit from explicit mobile responsiveness criteria
- Consider adding a task for house asset import functionality (Excel import)

## Code Quality Notes

- Good use of YAML frontmatter for structured metadata
- Consistent task ID naming convention (module.feature-name)
- Dependencies are properly ordered to ensure correct implementation sequence
- Test requirements are specified with appropriate patterns
